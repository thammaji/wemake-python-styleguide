Thesis

Yesterday I saw this code:

my_result = (first > 0 & second != 0) | other is None

And I was open_mouth

So, we need to check all operations around & and | and detect any booleans there:

    Explicit True and False
    Compares with is or == or !=
    Compares with >, >=, etc
    Logical operations not, or, and

If we can detect at least one of these operations, then we should raise a violation.
Let's call it BinaryAndBooleanMixupViolation.

Note: other binary operations are still fine!
So, these lines should not raise:

    first & second
    first | 10
    etc

Reasoning

This case indicates that a person confused & with and and | with or.
This can be the case if a person is comming from another language
